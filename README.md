The Amazon Clone project replicates the design and basic functionality of Amazon's homepage to simulate an e-commerce website. It features a responsive header with navigation links, including a logo, address selection, search bar, and user account options. The body includes a hero section that provides a location-based shopping prompt and a grid layout showcasing shopping categories with clickable boxes. The footer mirrors Amazon's style with "Back to Top" functionality, multiple informative panels, and links to company-related sections. Overall, this project emphasizes structured layout, intuitive design, and a user-friendly interface inspired by Amazon's website.
